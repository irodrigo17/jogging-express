# Jogging API

This is a RESTful API for the [Jogging app](https://github.com/irodrigo17/jogging-demo-app).

It's built on top of a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) stack, using [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) as the basic HTTP framework.

Storage is handled by [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) through [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/).
